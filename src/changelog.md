# Changelog

## v1.5

### What's new

- You can now set configuration values for asset, which means you can now decide which containers to run and which not to.
- Your project will now be accessible using a `domain.name` instead of `localhost:port`.
- You can now import a SQL dump file with just a single command without hesitation in both `MySQL` and `Postgres`.
- You can run a query from the terminal without starting a session with the database engine in both `MySQL` and `Postgres`.
- You can now attach additional `docker-compose-file.yml` to the existing one for more customization.
- You are not required to provide unique port to each project as `Docker` will assign a unique port to each project automatically.

## v1.0
