# Introduction

DockR is a package that interacts with `Docker` and `Laravel` to maintain the containers used for Local development of `Laravel App`.

DockR is able to create and maintain multiple number of projects at the same time with ease.

DockR is written using `Bash Script`.

## Reason for DockR
Developing a Laravel Site always remains simple with `Laravel Homestead` for Years.

But Apple had another plans.
When Apple Launched their Macs with `M1 chip (ARM based SOC)` an entirely different architecture in processor, Homestead is not supported for the Arm based M1 SOC.
This is due to different architecture`(ARM)` in M1 SOC where the Virtual Machine providers failed to update their software to support M1 chip. This Results in the support drop of Homestead.

To overcome this problem, Weâ€™ve searched for various alternatives to replace it in place of homestead which should work in both `Intel(x86 architecture)` and `M1(ARM architecture)`.
Finally, We planned to use `Docker` as the Virtual machine provider.

### Why Docker

- Docker is container based service provider. 
- Supports many architectures including `Intel(x86 architecture)` and `M1(ARM architecture)`.
- Docker can run multiple containers at once and consumes less memory.
- Docker Containers are lightweight and portable.
- A Docker container has same configuration even if transferred to various systems.

We can use docker as local development environment directly without use of any third party packages.
But it makes a bit of difficulty for developer run and use the container.

So we searched for various packages that integrates well into `Laravel` app and `Docker containers`.
