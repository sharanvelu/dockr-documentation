# Comparisons

Yeah, We(DockR) isn't the first tool to solve the development workload. There are tons and tons of options out there.
<br>Let's find the difference.

## Laravel Sail

Sail is a great tool for developing Laravel application.

- Sail supports only `PHP 8.0` and `PHP 8.1`. Most of our Laravel applications are years old and are far beyond migrating them to the latest version.
- Sail cannot connect multiple projects to same DB. Technically It can but it has some complications.
- Sail doesn't have the proxy to pass the domain based routing.

## Homestead

Homestead was the ultimate tool for local laravel development. The problem starts from the latest hardware tech.
<br>
It brings us back ton where DockR started.
<br>
Homestead doesn't support the latest M1 based Macs.
