## Requirements

DockR supports `Mac`, `Linux` and `Windows(WSL)`. Native Windows support are on its way.

Before we begin, make sure you have `Docker` and `curl` installed on your local machine.

Make sure Docker is `up to date`.

## Installation

Procedure for Installing DockR is the same for all `Operating System's`. However, installing and configuring `Docker` and `DockR` is quite different for `OS's`.

### *MAC*

You could install `Dockr` on your MAC through different ways.

Through `HomeBrew` :

```shell
brew install sharanvelu/dockr/dockr 
```

Or Through `Manual` Method :

```shell
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL install.dockr.in)"
```

And that's it, `DockR` should now be installed in your machine.
