# Installation

Installing `Dockr` on your local machine is very simple. Just run the following command in your terminal.

```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharanvelu/dockr/release/install.sh)"
```

And that's it, Dockr will take care of everything else.

This command will create a `Dockr` directory in your home directory and copies the necessary files to the location.

This command also creates an executable file `dockr` in `/usr/local/bin` directory. This enables you to run `dockr` command anywhere from your terminal.
